# Simple SQLite Clone in C++

A step-by-step implementation of a SQLite-compatible database from scratch in C++, designed to learn systems programming and database internals.

## 🎯 Educational Goals
- **Systems Programming**: Manual memory management, binary file I/O, and paging.
- **Database Internals**: Understanding B-Trees, Virtual Machines, and Buffer Pools.
- **OS Concepts**: How databases interact with the Operating System (fsync, cache).

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The database is structured in modular layers, processing a query from text to disk:

1.  **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**:
    -   Takes user input (SQL or meta-commands like `.exit`).
    -   Passes input to the Tokenizer.

2.  **Tokenizer & Parser**:
    -   Converts text string (`"select * from users"`) into a byte-code or internal representation.
    -   Checks for syntax errors.

3.  **Virtual Machine (VM)**:
    -   Executes the bytecode generated by the parser.
    -   Acts as the bridge between the query logic and the data structures.

4.  **B-Tree**:
    -   The core data structure for storing rows.
    -   Allows for fast insertion, deletion, and search ($O(\log N)$).
    -   Splits internal nodes and leaf nodes to maintain balance.

5.  **Pager**:
    -   Manages pages (fixed-size blocks of memory, e.g., 4KB) read from and written to the disk.
    -   Handles caching (Buffer Pool) to minimize disk I/O.

6.  **OS Interface**:
    -   Low-level file operations (`open`, `read`, `write`, `lseek`).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Frontend
- [x] **Step 1: REPL**: A simple command-line loop that accepts input.
- [ ] **Step 2: Tokenizer**: Breaking input into keywords and identifiers.
- [ ] **Step 3: Parser**: Validating syntax and creating a statement.

### Phase 2: The Backend (In-Memory)
- [ ] **Step 4: Row Structure**: Defining how data is stored in C++ structs.
- [ ] **Step 5: Table Structure**: Storing rows in a flat array (in-memory).

### Phase 3: Persistence
- [ ] **Step 6: Pager**: Reading/Writing 4KB pages to disk.
- [ ] **Step 7: Cursor**: Abstraction for iterating over the table.

### Phase 4: B-Tree Implementation
- [ ] **Step 8: Leaf Node Format**: Storing rows in B-Tree leaves.
- [ ] **Step 9: Internal Node Format**: Routing logic for the B-Tree.
- [ ] **Step 10: Splitting**: Handling full nodes.

## 🚀 Build & Run

### Prerequisites
